[DEFAULT]
# 'DEFAULT' as used above is a _special_ 'section' name which allows you to
# set defaults as you wish. For other 'section's, the name is of your choosing.

# When defining your own instances, you do not need to assign attributes
# if the default (as given here) is suitable.

# In the following (comment) field you can put anything you want.
# It is for the user's benefit and can be used as a means of 
# identifying the desired backup instance. 
# Note that there is no need for quotes.

# You may choose to back up the directory and all its contents or
# to back up only its content.  (See notes at end of this file.)

# name of the final directory in the path as the final directory 
# in the path designated by destination_dir.
