[DEFAULT]
# 'DEFAULT' as used above is a _special_ 'section' name which allows you to
# set defaults as you wish. For other 'section's, the name is of your choosing.

# When defining your own instances, you do not need to assign attributes
# if the default (as given here) is suitable.

# In the following (comment) field you can put anything you want.
# It is for the user's benefit and can be used as a means of 
# identifying the desired backup instance. 
# Note that there is no need for quotes.

# The next three fields request file hierarchies:
# It is advisable to use absolute paths; "~/" is expanded;
# relative paths are considered relative to $(pwd) but it may be 
# difficult to predict exactly what $(pwd) is! It is most likely
# to be the top level BackUp directory.

# YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO MAKE AN ENTRY FOR the next 2 FIELDS

# Source: directory to be backed up.
# You may choose to back up the directory and all its contents or
# to back up only its content.  (See notes at end of this file.)
# The presence or absence of a trailing '/' determines.
# It is suggested that you do add a slash to the end AND use the 
# name of the final directory in the path as the final directory 
# in the path designated by target.
# source = /path/to/source/directory/
# The following is used for testing:
source = BackUp/tests/data/source/

# Target: directory on the destination host where the bu.nnn
# snapshots are stored.  It is suggested that the final directory
# name of this path match that of the the one specified by source.
# The presence of a trailing slash makes no difference here.

# You may want to use an "exclude" file as defined by man rsync.
# exclude_file = /path/directory/rip_exclude

# If the exclude_file is not set, or if it refers to a file that
# doesn't exist, this parameter is silently ignored.

# host; otherwise use 'localhost' or leave blank.

###########################################################
remote_script = remote.py
# The script which is run on the target host to first read the
# params file and then to do the renaming (rippling) and the
# hard link copying which creats backup zero.
# Rippling increments the suffix of each snapshot (so that the
# file bu.000 is moved to bu.001, and so on down the line) thus
# making the bu.000 directory name available to be made into a
# hard link copy of the most recent backup and to serve as the
# target for the next backup.

# The following will need to be converted to absolute paths.
# If source has a trailing slash, special code preserves it.
