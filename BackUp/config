[DEFAULT]
# 'DEFAULT' as used above is a _special_ 'section' name which allows you to
# set defaults as you wish. For other 'section's, the name is of your choosing.

# When defining your own instances, you do not need to assign attributes
# if the default (as given here) is suitable.

# In the following (comment) field you can put anything you want.
# It is for the user's benefit and can be used as a means of 
# identifying the desired backup instance. 
# Note that there is no need for quotes.

# YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO MAKE AN ENTRY FOR the next 2 FIELDS

# considered relative to $(pwd) as you'd expect.
# Whether or not the source ends in a slash DOES have CONSEQUENCES.
# (See notes at end of this file.)

# Slash or no slash at end of destination directory matters not.
