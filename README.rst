BACKUP
######

``Backup`` is a command line utility for providing snapshot backups
written in Python 3.

When run it requires a single parameter which must match an entry in
either the default ``bu.config`` file or a file specified using the
``-c file.conf`` | ``--conf=file.conf`` option.  ``bu.config`` is
extensively commented and pretty well self explanatory.  Edit it to
suit your needs.
